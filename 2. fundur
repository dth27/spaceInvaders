2. fundur

Hvað þarf að gera:

Skipið - laga snúning (Diljá)
Bullet - Pétur
Enemies - Ragnar
Eyða út Rocks - Sandra
Super enemy - Sandra
Verndarveggi - Diljá
Backgrunn - Diljá

(í næstu viku, en má skoða núna)
Vantar event handling:

Virkni:
one Bullet
one of the enemies is powerup
if spaceship gets powerup he can shoot as much as he wants for a specific time

Levels (maybe)
Enemies come closer and closer
the closer, the more rockets they drop
and the more bullets the spaceship can shoot


Scoring system
Enemies firing bullets
Death handling (reset)
(ie. if ship is hit by enemy fire a certain amount of time)
Enemy movement (moving from side to side, as well as gradually
                moving closer to the ground)
Enemy death handling (if hit, disappear)

Win handling, ie. if won -> some msg appears
and user goes on to next level

(juicing)
Auka:

at start:
  enemies fly in and form the formation in a super cool way
  Main spaceship flies in into center positions
Music
Sound design
