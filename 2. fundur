Vantar event handling:

Scoring system
Enemies firing bullets
Death handling (reset)
(ie. if ship is hit by enemy fire a certain amount of time)
Enemy movement (moving from side to side, as well as gradually
                moving closer to the ground)
Enemy death handling (if hit, disappear)

Win handling, ie. if won -> some msg appears
and user goes on to next level

(juicing)
Auka:

at start:
  enemies fly in and form the formation in a super cool way
  Main spaceship flies in into center positions
Music
Sound design
